# CREAK Feature Descriptor Library

> Based on the works of Chen *et al.* from the CREAK: Color-based Retina Keypoint Descriptor article

> Built upon the FREAK feature descriptor as found in the OpenCV library



**The purpose of this repository is to provide the source code for the CREAK descriptor for academics who wish to perform research on the topic. The original article can be found [here](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c450/ffbc3b6844556d98a17e4ca5ade15c3f6a11.pdf)**
- The code is admittidy very crude, and was not designed with general use or sharing in mind.
- Any contribution or improvements are welcome!

**Dependancies:**
- OpenCV library 3.4.6 (4.1.0 should work)

**Disclaimer:**
- The code posted above is based on the original article by Chen *et al.* and in no way do I claim intellectual property on the CREAK algorithm.
