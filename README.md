# CREAK feature descriptor library

> Based on the works of Chen *et al.* from the CREAK: Color-based Retina Keypoint Descriptor article

> Built upon the FREAK feature descriptor as found in the OpenCV library



**The purpose of this repository is to provide the source code for the CREAK descriptor for academics who wish to perform research on the topic.**
- The code is admittidy very crude, and was not designed with general use or sharing in mind.
- Any contribution or improvements are welcome!

**Dependancies:**
- OpenCV library 3.4.6 (4.1.0 should work)


**Disclaimer:**
- The code posted above is based on the original article by Chen *et al.* and in no way do I claim intellectual property on the CREAK algorithm.
